# rulzexe

An LZEXE unpacker in ruby

## What is it

The old shareware Apogee games were packed with LZEXE, and it's useful to unpack them if you want to hack them and make mods etc. I reversed the LZEXE unpacker a few years ago, and figured it would be nice to come back and do it properly, rather than a weak rendering of the assembly code into python.
